<h1>Simple Bookshelf App</h1>
<p> This is my submission for final project from Dicoding Academy Course - Frontend Developer Beginner</p>
The objective of this project is to create a bookshelf app (like a library register) which allow us to register books to the bookshelf.
The bookshelf contains of 2 containers which is used to differentiate between books that had been read or not yet.

Basic concept used in this project is to use DOM as the primary modifier of HTML element. The way DOM changed the HTML structure is via javascript file <b>main.js</b>.
<br></br>
<ol>Here is some basic technique used in the javascript file:
<li>Javascript Functions</li>
<li>Array Operation</li>
<li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
<li>Event Listener</li>
<li>Event Handler</li>
<li>Element Selector</li>
<li>Form</li>
<li>Local Storage</li>
</ol>

For me, it's little confusing at first. But after several hours I figured out that this webpage has no big different with mobile apps that I've created using flutter. If you're familiar with flutter too, you might know that this web uses the same principle as flutter, like setState and sharedPreferences.
